learnings:
You should use rel="noopener noreferrer" on links (<a> tags) that have target="_blank".
Reason:
When you open a link in a new tab with target="_blank", the new page can access the original page via window.opener. This can be a security risk (the new page could potentially manipulate your page).
noopener prevents the new page from accessing window.opener.
noreferrer also prevents the browser from sending the referrer header, and it implies noopener in most browsers.
Example:
<a href="https://example.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
